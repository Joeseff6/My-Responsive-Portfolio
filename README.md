## Project Description

I will be making a personal portfolio for the world to see. The kicker to this project is that I will make not only use semantics to make my webpage accessible, but I must also make sure it is responsive.

## The Importance Of Responsiveness On a Webpage

Responsiveness refers to a webpage/web application's ability to properly present itself in different environments (whether it be mobile, on a desktop, minimizing a screen, etc). We don't want a user to try to bring up my webpage on a mobile device and have the page absolutely collapse on itself, rendering the webpage unusable or unappealing. Therefore, it important to ensure that the elements on the webpage will be responsive so that it can be properly displayed and accessible any time, any where.

## Tools to Include Responsive Features

For this project, I will be using Bootstrap's CSS framework to include elements and features that will be responsive; such a feature is a navigation bar to help navigate through the webpage. I will also need to ensure my layout and images are responsive as well. 
Bootstrap is a handy tool when it comes to page responsiveness since it utilizes a grid system, laying out the webpage in columns and rows. I will be utilizing classes to specify how many columns an element will use depending on the pixel size (or breakout point) of the webpage (-xs|-sm|-md|-lg|-xl).

## Objectives of This Project

To complete the project, I will need to ensure the following:

- [x] Ensure my portfolio contains a responsive navigation bar, layout, and images.
- [x] Ensure the navigation bar stays consistent (responsive) under different environments.
- [x] Include links for 3 separate pages in the navigation bar, and check that all links work.
- [x] Use semantic HTML.
- [x] Validate my webpages using a validation service.
- [x] Input personal information on my portfolio
- [x] Properly utilize the Bootstrap components and grid system.
