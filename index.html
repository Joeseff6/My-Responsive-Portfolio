                        My name is <strong>Joseph Soria</strong>, and I was born in Katy, Texas. I <strong>studied Mechanical Engineering at the University of Houston</strong>, and I <strong>currently work in the Oil and Gas industry</strong>.
                        My experience is diverse, as I have worked in Quality, Engineering, and Supply Chain, while interacting with all of these groups and more.
                        In my current position, I have learned how business works in a development, procurement, manufacturing, and operational standpoint. In the future, I see myself moving from Oil and Gas and 
                        branching out into Full Stack Web Development with the goal to deploy both web and mobile applications.
                    </p>
                    <p>
                        <strong>I'm currently undertaking a bootcamp from Rice University</strong> to continue my education and eventually make
                        a <strong>career change</strong>; this bootcamp will make me Employer-competitive as I <strong>learn skills such as HTML, CSS, Javascript</strong>, and much more.
                        As of now, I have used different technologies, such as Node.js, Express.js, Sequelize for ORM in MySQL, and Handlebars.js. I now have a couple of projects that
                        use these technologies to build a full stack application! These projects are showcased <a href="./project.html"><em>here</em></a>.

                <p>
                    As I mentioned before, I was <strong>born in Katy, Texas</strong>. However, I have moved around to different areas on the west side of Houston. I began to move around in 2013, and have
                    been moving since. I <strong>currently live in Cypress</strong>, which was the starting point of my commute to school in my undergrad days.
                </p>
                <p>
                    In 2012, <strong>I began my studies in the Lone Star College System</strong>, where I completed all my basic courses before starting at a four-year university. Years later (2015 to be exact),
                    I <strong>transferred to the University of Houston</strong>, where I pursued a degree in Mechanical Engineering. I <strong>graduated in 2018 with a GPA of 3.33</strong>, and undertook the Fundamentals of Engineering exam 
                    (FE exam for short). I had passed the exam and became a <strong>certified E.I.T</strong>, or Engineer in Training, while joining the American Society of Mechanical Engineers.
                </p>
                <p>
                    Enter the year 2020, where I have <strong>once again continued to further my education with the Full Stack Flex bootcamp</strong>, in partnership with <strong>Rice University</strong>. Here, I aim to learn and hone skills in 
                    multiple languages, <strong>with HTML, CSS, and Javascript only being a few of the skills</strong> I will learn in this course. Eventually, I will <strong>pursue a MBA degree</strong> to add to my arsenal.
